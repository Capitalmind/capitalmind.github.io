# Welcome to my Blog!
In this blog, I'll be covering a variety of topics that pique my interest. From **bash scripting** to **Ubuntu**, and from the **financial markets, economics** to **logic puzzles**, I'll be sharing my research, knowledge and insights with you. I'm also fascinated by paradoxes and other things of intrigue, so you can expect some thought-provoking content on those topics as well.

Whether you're a beginner or an expert in these areas, my aim is to provide useful and engaging content that will inform and entertain you. So, grab a cup of coffee and let's dive in!

## Tools of the trade

I'm using Git and fast.ai to create this blog as the best alternatives such as **blot.im** requires a small subscription and **write.as** and **writefreely.org** require additional setup. The goal; write in markdown and update/sync online immediately. My core LaTeX/Markdown note taker and general thinking pad is Obsidian.
