Found a few video files on my harddrive that were huge, 2160p. Decided to compress to 1080p and retain the audio quality and use a constant bit-rate for the compression quality.

To do this while retaining the best audio into a new MKV, a simple Bash command can be used, you can use the FFmpeg tool, which is a powerful command-line utility for video and audio encoding.

Assuming you have FFmpeg installed on your system, you can use the following command:

    #ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mkv

Here's what each part of the command does:

-i input.mkv: specifies the input file name, in this case, input.mkv.
-c:v libx264: sets the video codec to H.264 using the libx264 encoder, which is a widely used and high-quality codec.
-preset slow: sets the encoding preset to "slow," which trades off encoding speed for better quality.
-crf 18: sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 18, which is a high-quality setting that produces a large file size. You can experiment with different CRF values to find the right balance between quality and file size.
-c:a copy: copies the audio stream from the input file without re-encoding it, which preserves the original quality.
Finally, output.mkv is the name of the output file that will be created by FFmpeg.

Note that video encoding is a computationally intensive task, so the speed of the encoding process will depend on the hardware you are using. For a file over 100Gb you may need 24 hours of run time!
