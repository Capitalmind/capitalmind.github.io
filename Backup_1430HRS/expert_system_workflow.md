# Workflow\.md: Building an Expert System from a Defined Rule Set Using a Detailed Ontology

## Abstract

This document outlines a comprehensive workflow for developing a domain-specific expert system grounded in formal ontology and logical rule sets. It integrates natural language interfaces with symbolic reasoning, supporting applications in law, standards compliance, technical documentation, game mechanics, and business logic. Emphasis is placed on modularity, traceability, and determinism.

## 1. Introduction

Expert systems are AI systems that use a knowledge base of human expertise to solve complex problems. When integrated with ontologies, they become powerful engines for deterministic reasoning over structured domains such as law, engineering, games, and regulation compliance.

## 2. Use Case Scenarios

- **Legal Decision Engines**: Evaluate eligibility, compliance, and obligations based on structured law (e.g., tax thresholds, zoning rules).
- **Engineering Standards Compliance**: Validate project specifications against ISO or building codes.
- **Business Rules Engines**: Automate policy and compliance checks (e.g., insurance underwriting, financial loan validation).
- **Games and Simulations**: Enforce turn rules, win conditions, or character abilities using logical rules.
- **Medical Decision Support**: Use clinical guidelines and diagnostic rules to aid practitioners.

## 4. Tooling and Platform Selection

### Ontology Design

- **Protégé**: Visual OWL editor with reasoning support.
- **WebVOWL**: For visualizing RDF/OWL schemas.

### Rule-Based Engines

- **Drools (Java)**: Scalable forward-chaining rule engine.
- **CLIPS (C)**: Lightweight, embeddable logic engine.
- **Prolog**: Declarative programming for symbolic reasoning.
- **Rulex**: Commercial, visual rule processing.

### Knowledge Graphs

- **Neo4j + Cypher**: Excellent for large, complex relationships.
- **RDF/OWL + SPARQL**: For standard web ontology queries.

### NLP and Language Interfaces

- **spaCy** + **NER**: For extracting intents/entities.
- **LangChain**, **Haystack**, **LlamaIndex**: LLM orchestration tools.

### Storage

- **Graph DBs**: For ontologies and rules.
- **Document DBs (MongoDB)**: For structured examples.
- **Relational DBs**: For structured transaction logging.

## 5. Ontology Development

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Extract Key Terms**: Parse your domain source (e.g., legal code, rulebook).
2. **Define Classes**: Represent each noun/entity as a class (e.g., `Person`, `Business`, `Threshold`).
3. **Attributes and Types**: Model key attributes (e.g., `income: Number`).
4. **Relationships**: Express logical relationships (`owns`, `applies_to`, `is_subject_to`).
5. **Taxonomy and Inheritance**: Generalize shared properties (`Entity` ← `Person`, `Organization`).
6. **Represent in OWL/RDF**: Use Protégé or Turtle syntax.

## 6. Rule Encoding

### Methods

- **Declarative Rules** (Prolog, Drools): Encode `if-then` relationships.
- **Production Rules**: `IF condition THEN action`
- **Constraint Rules**: Used in standards (e.g., ISO), encoded as validations.

### Example (Legal)

```prolog
must_register_gst(Person) :-
    income(Person, X), X > 60000,
    business_operating_in_nz(Person).
```

## 7. Knowledge Base Construction

1. **Source Trusted Data**: Use statute databases, certified manuals, validated scenarios.
2. **Normalize**: Convert to standard schemas.
3. **Annotate**: Link to ontology terms.
4. **Store**: Use JSON-LD, RDF, or graph structures.

## 8. Query and Inference Mechanisms

### Mechanisms

- **SPARQL**: For querying RDF triples.
- **Backward/Forward Chaining**: For inference based on known facts.
- **Logical Traceability**: Explain why a rule fired.

### Sample Query (SPARQL)

```sparql
SELECT ?entity
WHERE {
  ?entity :income ?amount .
  FILTER (?amount > 60000)
}
```

## 9. Integration with Natural Language Interfaces

1. **Intent Recognition**: Use spaCy or an LLM.
2. **Slot Filling**: Extract values for structured queries.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Convert user input into structured formats.
4. **LLM Safety Layer**: Only use LLMs for translation, not decision-making.

## 10. Validation and Testing

- **Unit Test Rules**: Evaluate each rule with pass/fail scenarios.
- **Ontological Consistency**: Use Protégé reasoners.
- **Regression Testing**: Against historical cases.
- **Auditable Logs**: Every output must trace back to input and logic path.

## 11. Deployment Considerations

- **Modular APIs**: Separate rule engine, ontology server, and UI.
- **Versioning**: Use Git or RDF versioning for traceability.
- **Security**: Ensure immutable audit logs, especially for law or health.
- **Explainability**: Each result must provide a "why".

## 12. Future Extensions

- **Integration with Blockchain**: For immutable legal records.
- **Cross-Domain Reasoning**: Use multiple ontologies together.
- **Active Learning**: Refine NLP interface with feedback.
- **Standardization**: Publish OWL schemas for community reuse.

## Conclusion

Building a zero-error expert system requires careful ontology design, rule encoding, and deterministic reasoning. LLMs provide accessibility, not authority. The future of trustworthy AI lies in the marriage of symbolic reasoning and natural interaction — traceable, testable, and exact.

**Author's Note:** This paper is intended as a high-level workflow suitable for legal informatics, compliance AI, standards enforcement, and structured simulations. For real-world implementation, the ontology and rule sets must be developed with domain experts and validated with rigorous case testing.
